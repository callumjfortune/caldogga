# Caldog ga

Caldogga replicates the realtime graphics used in BBC broadcasts. Unlike the real implementation which uses Vue and Nuxt, I have opted for a next JS and React approach. Additionally I have integrated a websocket server to allow the realtime animations to be controlled from a seperate interface.

Running the app is simple and will spin up a next server and a websocket server concurrently

To start the project run:

`npm i && npm run start`
